Achieving Greener Commutes: Evidence From GPS-Tracked Mobility and Routing Scenarios in Boston

Submitted to TRB 2026 Annual Meeting

Abstract:

Integrating greenery into everyday travel routes enhances the urban experience of commuters. This study quantifies experienced urban tree coverage exposure using continuous multimodal GPS traces from 990 Boston residents linked to a high-resolution canopy layer. Unlike prior studies relying on residence buffers, coarse vegetation metrics, or assumed shortest paths, we quantify empirically observed, multimodal route-level tree coverage exposure at trip resolution to reveal distributional differences. We first report baseline exposure by mode and income. Biking trips exhibit higher average tree canopy exposure than walking or public transit trips, yet lower-income participants experience less canopy per distance traveled. Mode-switch scenarios (e.g., shifting walking trips to biking) increase mean exposure and reduce income level differences in tree cover age exposure. A multinomial logit model shows that travel time dominates utility, while marginal differences in canopy have only a small effect, suggesting the benefits are not fully reflected in revealed choices. We then evaluate two pedestrian routing strategies to improve tree canopy exposure: (1) selecting the greenest path of approximately equal length yields a 1.58 percentage point gain in exposure, and (2) applying a tree coverage weighted cost function that allows modest detours increases exposure by up to 6.55 percentage points. In the second strategy, gains are 1.5 percentage points larger for lower-income walkers, indicating that better routing tools could help close observed exposure gaps without requiring new infrastructure. Integrating mobility traces with environmental layers reveals actionable, mode- and income-specific levers to enhance every day contact with the urban canopy.
